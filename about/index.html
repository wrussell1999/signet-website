<p>
    The resulting SigneT is probably the easiest to build two-person boat. The hard-chine wooden hull, designed for home building in your average single garage without the need for fancy tools, is a lasting design. 
    <br>
    Now you can have SigneTs built for you, home-build or buy second-hand. The oldest example built to the current design is SigneT ST2; it was built in 1961 and was sailing competitively within the fleet until very recently. It now forms an important part of the National Collection at the National Maritime Museum in Falmouth - see <a href="http://nmmc.co.uk/object/boats/signet-dinghy/">here for more.</a>
