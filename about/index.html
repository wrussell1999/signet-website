    The resulting SigneT is probably the easiest to build two-person boat. The hard-chine wooden hull, designed for home
    building in your average single garage without the need for fancy tools, is a lasting design. Now you can have
    SigneTs
    built for you, home-build or buy second-hand. The oldest example built to the current design is SigneT ST2; it was
    built
    in 1961 and was sailing competitively within the fleet until very recently. It now forms an important part of the
    National Collection at the National Maritime Museum in Falmouth - see <a
        href="http://nmmc.co.uk/object/boats/signet-dinghy/">here for more.</a>

    The SigneT was designed for all the family. It is small enough, with jib, to be handled by children in moderate
    winds
    and its stability makes it ideal for training. Yet fully equipped, with Genoa and a 90 square foot spinnaker, it
    makes
    for some very exciting racing.

    The class is a family class, which welcomes new members, whether as experienced sailors or novices. Both individuals
    and
    families are equally welcomed in a fleet where all age groups race together in a competitive, but supportive and
    friendly atmosphere. There are opportunities for beginners to sail with experienced members of the fleet and also
    for
    non-racers to cruise.

    <br>
    And as long ago as July 1963, a bunch of SigneTs crossed the English Channel (including ST2) to demonstrate the
    seaworthiness of what was at the time perceived to be too small a boat for coastal work.

    <br>
    Non-sailing supporters are equally welcome and many lasting friendships are made on the bank.

    The association runs a series of Open Meetings at various venues between May and September. We also hold a full
    weekâ€™s
    National Championships in early August each year, with the nationals venues taking us variously to both coastal
    waters
    and inland lakes. We offer help and advice on all aspects of SigneT sailing including buying or building a SigneT,
    fitting a SigneT, measurement, tuning or any other question you can think of relating to SigneT sailing. We are also
    able to put new members in touch with other SigneT sailors around the UK for local support and advice.
