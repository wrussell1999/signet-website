# 2022 Report

2022 has been a great season for the SigneT after the challenges of COVID-19 the last 2 years have brought. The fleet came back stronger than ever with 4 opens and the National Championship!

## Hunts - May 2022
The year started out with the open at Hunts Sailing Club alongside the CVDRA Rally. Some of the fleet weren’t well, while others were still missing paint on their boat meaning only 4 boats turned up but keen nonetheless! We were met with very little wind but that didn’t stop our keen sailors getting rigged up and launching! We saw some more wind build towards the end of the day which created some tight racing between John Panting and Harry Badcock, and Pat Overs and Bertie Badcock. John and Harry were able to just jump ahead securing 2nd overall, with Pat and Bertie claiming 3rd.

## Frensham - May 2022
Next up, the fleet travelled down to Surrey for the Frensham Pond Open! We saw a new boat in the fleet, Will Russell and Natalie Smith had just finished repainting 921, with the help of the Overs, in a nice blue and white, but without many fittings! The locals stormed ahead using their local knowledge, with a tight race between the boats that had travelled. Luke and Rebecca powered ahead with 3 bullets putting them in 1st overall. With the shifty and gusty nature of the pond, positions changed frequently during each race, especially in the final race where Kate Taylor and Frank Goodall managed to squeeze past Pat Overs and Steve Whiteside to take 2nd place, bumping them up into 2nd overall! Despite a rocky start with the newly refurbished boat, Will and Natalie managed to hold onto 3rd overall.

Launching and recovering proved challenging for a few in the fleet, with Will taking 10 attempts to not miss the pontoon and Steve getting stuck in the edges of the pond!

## Broadstairs - July 2022
In July, we went to the coast to tackle the waves at Broadstairs. We saw a few crew swap around as Mike Overs was lacking a tow bar, and others without their usual crews. Regardless, we still had a strong turn out of 7 boats. Luke and Rob Anstey sped off into the distance, showing their experience with tidal conditions. Will Russell and Natalie Smith didn’t have the best starts, but all their new fittings to the boat helped them power into 2nd overall, especially with their upwind speed. Tom Field-Stevens showed his local knowledge of the tide and waves, speeding ahead into 3rd overall. 

The racing was very tight, but that didn't stop a few funny moments! John and Mike were cruising along on one of the reaches but in the blink of an eye, they were both in the water swimming after their upside boat! No one is really sure what happened but it's a good reminder that anything could happen! Will kept hitting the gybe mark, finding himself doing more 360s than he could count!

## Nationals - August 2022
Only a few weeks later, we went to Mersea Island for our National Championships at Dabchicks Sailing Club! The fun started for some people before the racing even started! Mike used a small outboard to get himself across the estuary to overcome his lack of tow bar arriving the most ready!

With a big course, lots of tide and a mix of conditions, anything could happen! Kate and Frank had a consistent week scoring 1st and 2nds to help them secure the win overall. Hannah and Eddie made them work hard for it being closely behind claiming 2nd overall. Will and Natalie had a right mix of results but a very near win in the final race helped them secure 3rd overall!

Every boat with a spinnaker was keen to give it a go, some more keen than others. Will and Natalie were often seen hoisting first, even if it didn't make sense! A couple had a few challenges, such as Tom running over his kite and capsizing in the process - shame it wasn't recorded!

Boats weren't without their breakages either! Tom's rudder pintle didn't look like it was going to stay attached to his boat for the whole week so a quick trip to the local chandlery resolved that! Will's mainsheet block decided it no longer wanted to be attached to the boom for the final day of racing, making for a heavy main!

Sadly, racing was cut short due to a lack of wind on the final day which helped Will secure 3rd place from Mike as they were on equal points. Kate's 1st had already been secured. The Single Handled Trophy was postponed - hopefully we can see it return for 2023!

Of course, the SigneT fleet wouldn't be complete without the wonderful shore crew and arts and craft group who were busy making wonderful art in the sun, or watching the racing on the beach! It also wouldn't be a SigneT Nationals without the SigneT team winning the pub quiz with the Miracle fleet. This isn't the first time and definitely won't be the last!

## Paxton - September 2022
To round off the season, we had the Paxton Open in the middle of September. Saturday brought some lovely weather in both wind and temperature making for a fun day for those on and off the water! Paxton is known for its unpredictable wind shifts and random gusts which made for some tight racing! Going into the weekend, Kate Taylor and Frank led the traveller series with Will Russell and Natalie Smith in a close second. Mike and Felix Overs would get the 7 races they needed to qualify after Saturday, but would the results be enough to bump them into first!

The racing was unpredicable but Mike and Felix managed to secure the 3 wins they needed to win the 2022 Traveller Series! Will and Natalie came 2nd overall and won the Best New Comer prize. You can check out the full results for 2022 [here](/results/2022).
