# 2022 Report

## Hunts - May 2022
The year started out with the open at Hunts Sailing Club alongside the CVDRA Rally. Some of the fleet weren’t well, while others were still missing paint on their boat meaning only 4 boats turned up but keen nonetheless! We were met with very little wind but that didn’t stop our keen sailors getting rigged up and launching! We saw some more wind build towards the end of the day which created some tight racing between John Panting and Harry Badcock, and Pat Overs and Bertie Badcock. John and Harry were able to just jump ahead securing 2nd overall, with Pat and Bertie claiming 3rd.

## Frensham - May 2022
Next up, the fleet travelled down to Surrey for the Frensham Pond Open! We saw a new boat in the fleet, Will Russell and Natalie Smith had just finished repainting 921, with the help of the Overs, in a nice blue and white, but without many fittings! The locals stormed ahead using their local knowledge, with a tight race between the boats that had travelled. Luke and Rebecca powered ahead with 3 bullets putting them in 1st overall. With the shifty and gusty nature of the pond, positions changed frequently during each race, especially in the final race where Kate Taylor and Frank Goodall managed to squeeze past Pat Overs and Steve Whiteside to take 2nd place, bumping them up into 2nd overall! Despite a rocky start with the newly refurbished boat, Will and Natalie managed to hold onto 3rd overall.

## Broadstairs - July 2022
In July, we went to the coast to tackle the waves at Broadstairs. We saw a few crew swap around as Mike Overs was lacking a tow bar, and others without their usual crews. Regardless, we still had a strong turn out of 7 boats. Luke and Rob Anstey sped off into the distance, showing their experience with tidal conditions. Will Russell and Natalie Smith didn’t have the best starts, but all their new fittings to the boat helped them power into 2nd overall, especially with their upwind speed. Tom Field-Stevens showed his local knowledge of the tide and waves, speeding ahead into 3rd overall. 

## Nationals - August 2022
Only a few weeks later, we went to Mersea Island for our National Championships at Dabchicks Sailing Club!

## Paxton - September 2022
To round off the season, we had the Paxton Open in the middle of September. Saturday brought some lovely weather in both wind and temperature making for a fun day for those on and off the water! Paxton is known for its unpredictable wind shifts and random gusts which made for some tight racing! Going into the weekend, Kate Taylor and Frank led the traveller series with Will Russell and Natalie Smith in a close second. Mike and Felix Overs would get the 7 races they needed to qualify after Saturday, but would the results be enough to bump them into first!

The racing was unpredicable but Mike and Felix managed to secure the 3 wins they needed to win the 2022 Traveller Series! Will and Natalie came 2nd overall and won the Best New Comer prize. You can check out the full results for 2022 [here](/results/2022).
