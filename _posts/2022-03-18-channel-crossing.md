# SigneT Channel Crossing 60th Anniversary

As most of you will be aware (and some may remember!) in 1963 four SigneTs made a memorable channel crossing from St Margarets Bay to Calais. To celebrate the Sixtieth Anniversary of this remarkable feat we have been working on recreating this voyage in June 2023. The exact date is tbc based on participant availability, weather and tides but will be in the first two weeks of June. We intend to raise sponsorship for the RNLI, a charity that SCOA has supported for many years, and the Ellen Macarthur Cancer Trust. Planning for this going well but, as you can no doubt imagine, is quite involved. The plan is to work with Channel Swim pilot vessels to ensure the voyage happens in a safe manner.

There is the opportunity to express your interest in getting involved with the challenge (whether in a sailing capacity or otherwise!) at the following google form:

We are approaching sponsors to fund the costs of the voyage but are not yet currently met, if you think you can help in this manner we have a go fund me page here: [https://gofund.me/b0fb7163](https://gofund.me/b0fb7163)

We are really excited about this and hope to get lots of SCOA members involved in a memorable event. The challenge will be publicly launched to the wider sailing community (and beyond) in mid April. To this end we would be grateful if you could respond the google form by **26th March**.
