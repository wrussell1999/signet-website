The SigneT is a 12’4” traditional racing dinghy designed in 1961 by the late <a href="/history/ianproctor">Ian Proctor</a>. In Ian’s own words, “the
design problem set by the Sunday Times was to provide really good sailing and racing at the lowest possible cost” and
over 50 years later the SigneT does exactly that.
